## PCAP Capstone

### Description
The CPTC competition is a pentesting competition in which teams are “hired” to pentest a simulated business environment. Students in this project will produce a proof of concept (PoC) code module, written in Golang, which can accept a given network capture (PCAP format) and replay the traffic between virtual machines to simulate live business traffic. This tool will be integrated into the CPTC competition to further assist the simulation of a live business environment during the competition.

### Goals/Deliverables
-A PoC code module that is:
-Able to replay network captures
-Able to handle traffic to and from multiple systems simultaneously
-Linted
-Commented
-Work with version control software (i.e. Git) to collaborate
